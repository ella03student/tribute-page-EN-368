  </p>
    <p>
<b>1930s - </b>She had a strained relationship with her parents and turned to poetry as an emotional outlet. She also changed her name from “Audrey” to “Audre” for the sake of artistic symmetry with her last name.
  </p>
    <p>
<b>1940s - </b>Audre attended Hunter College High School (a high school for intellectually gifted students) but felt like an outcast due to her being "both crazy and queer.”

  </p>

    <p>

    </p>

  </p>
    <p>
<b>1968 - </b>Lorde served as writer-in-residence at Tougaloo College in Mississippi and led workshops with her black undergraduate students. She also reaffirmed her identity as "crazy and queer" and vowed to live according to that.

<p>
<b>1970 - </b>She and Edwin Rollins divorced.
  </p>
    <p>
<b>1970 to 1981 - </b>Audre taught English at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and fought for the creation of a black studies department there. She also helped found the Women's Coalition of St. Croix (an organization that supports survivors of sexual abuse).
